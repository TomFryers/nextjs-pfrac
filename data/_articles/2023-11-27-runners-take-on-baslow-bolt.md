summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Several Penistone runners made the trip into the Peak District to compete in the Baslow Bolt fell race.  The race is approximately 7.5 miles long with 1300ft of elevation gain. It takes in a variety of terrain, including fields, woodland, and paths with some steep ascents and descents.  The race starts at St Anne's Church in Baslow and heads north up the River Derwent. The route then takes in fields and woodland before reaching Curbar Edge, where there is a steep climb to Curbar Gap. From there, the route follows Baslow Edge, a ridge with stunning views of the surrounding countryside. The race then descends Bar Road back to Baslow to finish at St Anne's Primary School.

Two Penistone runners, Phil Hinchliffe and Robin Clough, cycled the 65 mile round trip in sub zero temperatures to compete in the event.  Their running kit unfortunately didn’t arrive but luckily other runners were able to lend them the necessary kit to take part in the race.  Despite running in borrowed gear and having tired legs from the cycling Phil was the first Penistone runner back, finishing in 34th overall in a time of 1-00-58.

First female runner back for Penistone was Suzanne McGill who was 23rd female finisher in 1-17-12.  Prizes were awarded to Ray Brown for being the oldest runner in the race and to Phil and Robin for their runs in borrowed gear.

Michael Nicholson and Peter Beaver competed in the Wilmslow Festive 10k.  The race saw Michael grab a PB for the distance in 43-52.  A good number of Penistone runners also took part in the Doncaster 10k.
