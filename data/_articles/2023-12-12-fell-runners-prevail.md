summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Due to snowy weather conditions at the weekend many running events were postponed including the very popular Percy Pud 10k road race which attracts nearly 3,000 runners.  It is now due to be re-run next weekend, when the weather should be much improved.

One event which went ahead despite the weather was the [Gravy Pud](http://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2023/bill-fox-gravy-pud-race) fell race.  It is held in Tintwistle in Derbyshire and is five miles long with 800 feet of climbing.  The route was challenging with steep hills, rough terrain along with a covering of snow.  George Parr was the first Penistone runner back claiming sixth place.   Other Penistone runners completing the course were Jon Hallam, Steve Sanders, Lesley Parker and Helen Wright.

At the Doncaster 10k on the previous weekend Bill Phillips secured first place in the men’s over75 age category with 48-04.  This also gave Bill a new club record.

On the [parkrun](http://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2023/2023-12-02) scene Dawn Broom placed second lady at the Thonock Lane Farm parkrun in 23-21.  This also gave Dawn an age group record for the course in the ladies over55 category.
