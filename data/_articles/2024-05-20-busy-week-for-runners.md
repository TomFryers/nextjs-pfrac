A good number of Penistone runners made the trip over to Derbyshire on Saturday to take part in the challenging 20 mile Hathersage Hurtle in hot conditions.  The race takes in the many Derbyshire hills around Hathersage and follows a stunningly scenic route.  The club enjoyed success with Suzanne McGill grabbing first lady and Shaun Swallow claiming first over50 man.  Jemma Williams also had a good run to come home fifth over40 lady.  Others completing the course were Robin Clough, Chloe Worth, Heather Graham, Phil Hinchliffe, Chris Lowe and Tracy Woodward.
