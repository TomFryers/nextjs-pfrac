summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Twenty six Penistone runners took on the [Travellers 6](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/championship-2023/travellers-6) which is a challenging 6 mile race with a mix of uphill and downhill sections on quiet rural roads around Denby Dale.  First back for the club was Simon Pike in 30th place in a time of 42-59.   First lady back for the club was Suzanne McGill in 48-58.  Suzanne’s performance was good enough to give her first place in the ladies over45 age category.  Bill Phillips was also in the prizes claiming first place in the men’s over75 age category.  His time of 51-34 was also a new [club record](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/records/) for the 6 mile distance.  There were also first places for Barbara Haigh (over75 ladies) and Ray Brown (over80 men).

Elsewhere Peter Beever competed in the 4.5 mile Santa Special trail run organised by Kimberworth Striders.

On the [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2023/2023-12-16) scene there were first places for James Fryers (Rothay Park) and Flynn Rogers (Hillsborough Juniors).  Richard Cottam and Rachael Mayston both claimed second places at Barnsley and Penistone respevtively.

**Volunteer Andrew notches up 100 parkruns**

[Andrew Taylor](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/parkrunner/4198059/) from Penistone has completed 186 parkruns but last weekend Andrew passed his 100 volunteer milestone, as tailwalker at the Barnsley parkrun. Andrew mainly volunteers at Barnsley parkrun and Barnsley junior parkrun but has also volunteered at other local and events further afield. He has undertaken many roles including run director, volunteer coordinator, timekeeper, barcode scanner, marshal and tailwalker amongst other roles.  Andrew says “There are roles which mean you have to give up your run once in a while but there are ones which you can get both a run and volunteer credit for example tailwalker, car park marshal, first timers briefing and token sorting. Junior parkrun volunteer credits also count.  Parkrun happens every Saturday at 0900 and junior parkrun every Sunday at 0900. Please check out your [local event](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/events/events/#geo=4/51.55/3.2) for ways to get involved.
