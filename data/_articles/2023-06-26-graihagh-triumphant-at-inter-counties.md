summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Graihagh Turner put in an excellent performance while representing Yorkshire at the Junior Inter Counties Fell Championships.  Competing in the girls under17 category Graihagh won by a clear two minutes on a challenging course set in the Shropshire hills.

There was further success for Penistone Footpath Runners when they had the first three finishers at the James Blakeley fell race.  Winner of the men’s race and first back was Tom Fryers who was followed in by Richard Cottam and brother James.  Not surprisingly Penistone picked up the men’s team prize too.

Penistone entered a number of teams in the Dam Flask relay event which takes place every year around the Dam Flask Reservoir near Low Bradfield.  Standout performance was from the men’s over60 team of Richard Docker, Stuart Woodhead and Bill Phillips who picked up bronze.

A strong contingent of Penistone runners took part in the Round Sheffield run which is an annual multi-stage running event that is 15 miles in length and divided into 11 stages.  Runners can take part in pairs or as individuals.  First male pairing back for Penistone was Richard and David Mackie in 1-32-17.  First lady pairing back was Chloe Worth and Kate Sandilands in 1-50-28.  Tony Wright was the first solo male back for the club in 1-33-36 and first lady was Suzanne McGill in 1-39-35.

On the parkrun scene Lisa Hinchliffe was first lady at Barnsley in 26-50 and Flynn Rogers took first place at Hillsborough juniors in 7-25.  Annie Lightowler completed her 150th parkrun at Lyme Park in Disley.
