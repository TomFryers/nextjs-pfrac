---
Despite the adverse weather conditions over the weekend brought about by Storm Bert, many Penistone runners managed to compete in a mix of races around the region and beyond.  Five runners headed to Cheshire to take part in the Wilmslow Festive 10k.  There were age category podiums for Dawn Broom (second over60 lady) and Rachael Mayston (third over50 lady).  Dawn’s time was 45-09 and Rachael’s 41-40.  Others ran well including James Mumford (35-44), Martin Ball (37-01) and John Broom (40-21).

A little closer to home but over the same distance, several Penistone runners took on the Doncaster 10k.  First back for the club was Sean Pitt in 38-49 followed by Ian Neville in 40-20 which also gave him seventh place in the men’s over55 age category.  First lady back was Emma Moore in 45-07.

Five runners took part in the Clowne Half Marathon.  Simon Pike took a tumble in the race but was still first back for Penistone in 1-34-54.  First lady back was Sarah Lee in 1-58-39.  Ian McNulty made the trip to Spain to compete in the Benidorm Half Marathon finishing in 2-05-43.
