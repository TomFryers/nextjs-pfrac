A contingent of senior and junior Penistone runners made the short journey to Mirfield to compete in the Hoppits Hill races.  The seniors race was 3 miles in distance with 700 feet of climbing.  First senior male back for Penistone was Richard Cottam in tenth place recording a time of 21-28.  Junior Graihagh Turner was first female back for Penistone and second lady overall in a time of 22-49.  Richard and Graihagh were in the prizes along with a number of other Penistone runners.  As well as picking up a prize for second female overall Graihagh picked up second place in the female under15 category.  Richard picked up third place in the competitive men’s over40 age category.  Other runners in the prizes were Ray Brown (first over80 male), Barbara Haigh (first over70 female), Sarah Walch (second over40 female) and Richard Mackie (third over50 male).  There was also success in the junior races where Monty Hallam was second in the boys under11 race and Onnee Turner was twelfth in the girls under13 race.

Further afield James Fryers had an excellent run to claim fourth place at the Northumberland Coast Half Marathon which runs from Craster to Bamburgh.  A beautiful route that includes a beach section.  Conditions were tough with runners running into a headwind for the whole race!  James’s strong run also gave him first place in the male under20 category.
