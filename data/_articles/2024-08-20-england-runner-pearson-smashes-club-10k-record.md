summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Andrew Pearson demonstrated his credentials as one of the best male over60 runners in the country with a rapid performance at the Wistow 10k.  His time of 37-24 gave him first place in his age category and also a new [club record](http://results.pfrac.co.uk/records/).  Clubmate Rob Davies placed second in the same age category in 45-32.  Lee Nash also competed and placed 18th overall in a time of 38-47.

Kelvin Bowskill picked up first over70 man at the Maltby Butchers Dog Leg which is the latest in a series of races over the summer known as the KMR (Kimberworth, Maltby, Rotherham) series.  The latest race was a challenging 4.5 mile trail race.

Monday saw this summer's seventh running of the [Trunce](http://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/trunce-7) trail race.  The Trunce course is particularly known for its three river crossings which add an extra element of fun and challenge.  George Parr was first back for Penistone in third place overall in a time of 26-53.  There were age group golds for Alan Knox (first over70 man), Majka Kunicka (first over40 lady), Lois Lopez (first over50 lady) and Barbara Haigh (first over70 lady).

Thursday saw the final [Silkstone Shuffle](http://results.pfrac.co.uk/championship-2024/silkstone-shuffle-3) race of the summer and Penistone runners were well represented.  First back for the club was Simon Pike in fourth place in 33-48.  Simon was closely followed by teammate Dan Rushforth who was fifth overall in 33-55.  Thursday also saw the [Denis Stitt](http://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/denis-stitt) fell race take place.  George Parr secured third place again in a time of 32-01.  Penistone runners competing secured top three age group positions.  They were Steve Storey (first over65 man), Myfanwy Cross (first over40 lady), Matthew Coldwell (third over45 man) and Nick Whittingham (third over70 man).

Damian Kilpin had a busy week. On Wednesday he competed in the [Cracken Edge](http://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/cracken-edge) fell race where he placed 28th overall which was enough to give him 3rd place in the men's over45 age category.  Sarah Walch also competed and went one better, grabbing second in the ladies over40 age category.  Damian followed this up at the weekend with a great run to complete the extremely tough 46 mile Skiddaw Ultra in the Lake District.  He placed fifth man in a time of 9-52.

On the [Parkrun](http://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2024/2024-08-10) scene there were high placings for Suzanne McGill (first at Hillsborough Parkrun) and George Parr (second man at Glossop Parkrun). There was a Parkrun milestone for Carl Matthewman who completed his 50th parkrun at Aviemore.  Age graded performances of the week were Dawn Broom (87.97%), Suzanne McGill (84.73%), Julia Johnson (82.09%), Sue Hall (76.74%) and George Parr (74.78%).
