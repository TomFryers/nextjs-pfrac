summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Penistone youngster Graihagh Turner enjoyed more success this weekend whilst representing England at the Schools Cross Country Internationals held in Ireland. Turner was part of the Intermediate Mixed Relay team, completing leg one with a healthy lead which ensured her team returned with the gold medal.

Her Rotherham Harriers team-mate Maya Schofield also enjoyed success, being part of the Junior Mixed Relay team who also claimed gold.

There was another gold medal for George Parr who finished in first place in this year’s Chicken Run fell race in Hayfield. The 8.3 mile route consists of 1421 ft of ascent and Penistone were well represented with six runners in a field of over 200.

Penistone’s Pete Beever travelled to Dalby Forest in North Yorkshire to take part in their 10k race. Beever came home in a time of 54:56 to claim 57th place out of 163.

Two Penistone runners took on the brutal 21 mile Edale Skyline fell race on Sunday, with a whopping 4505 ft of climbing involved. James Fryers started the race strongly and, despite feeling unwell for the last 10km, held on for 74th position, just a few minutes behind club-mate Richard Cottam in 68th who is training for a Bob Graham Round attempt in the coming months.

In the weekend’s parkrun events, there were first places for Tom Fryers at Milton Country, James Mumford at Lister Park and Suzanne McGill at Penistone, whilst Rob Lees finished second at Northallerton.

Several Penistone runners travelled to Middleton Woods parkrun where Andrew Taylor completed his 200th parkrun.
