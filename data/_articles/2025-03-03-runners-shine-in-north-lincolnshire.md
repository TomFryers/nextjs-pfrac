summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
A strong contingent of Penistone runners headed to North Lincolnshire to compete in the hugely popular 10k and half marathon road running events.  Conditions were excellent for running, and the flat courses were conducive to personal bests and fast times.  Martin Ball had a strong run in the 10k event picking up first place in the men’s over50 age category which had a field of 44 runners.  He clocked an impressive time of 36-44.

Seven runners took on the half marathon distance and many were rewarded with personal bests.  First back for the club was Suzanne McGill in a time of 1-27-39 which gave her second place in the ladies over45 age category.  First male back was Robin Clough who improved his previous year’s time by over 10 minutes finishing in a time of 1-32-50.  Not far behind, Simon Lovidge achieved a new personal best time of 1-35-17.  Olivia Clough completed her first ever half marathon in a time of 2-05-34 which was much faster than she expected to run.

On the fells Graihagh Turner took on the [Ilkley Moor](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/ilkley-moor) fell race which is a challenging 8 kilometre race featuring steep ascents and descents across Ilkley’s scenic moorland.  This was Graihagh’s first senior fell race, and she put in a great performance to finish fourth lady overall and first under19 lady in a time of 50-30.

Harriet Drouin and Mark Crossley completed the 5 Res’s Trail Run, which is a 25 kilometres run taking in the reservoirs of Dovestones before the infamous boulder field before Rimmons Clough.  Mark finished in 41st place in 3-21 closely followed by Harriet in 3-24.

On the [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2025/2025-03-01) scene, there was a first gender place for Jade Crosby at Barnsley, while Millie Lees took second gender place at the Barnsley junior parkrun.  Dawn Broom took third gender place at Riverfront and Tom Fryers took third gender place at Penistone.  There was a huge PB for Jill Scrivens at Doddington Hall recording 24-15.  Dan Cooper completed his 150th parkrun at Glossop.  Age graded runs of the week were Dawn Broom (90.23%), Ian Neville (78.45%), Tom Fryers (74.21%), Sue Hall (74.11%) and Jill Scrivens (72.71%).  Dawn’s mark of 90.23% is an amazing achievement showing her to be one of the best runners in her age category in the country.

The club ran a quiz night at the Penistone Tap and in doing so encouraged participants to bring along non perishable food items to be donated to Penistone Foodbank.  [Food Matters Stocksbridge](https://foodmatterstest.site/) commented "A BIG Friday thank-you to all our supporters, and, a special shout out this week to Matthew and Myfanwy from the Penistone Footpath Runners for the very generous food bag donations raised from the Runners quiz night."
