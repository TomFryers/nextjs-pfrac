Richard Cottam of Penistone Footpath runners showed a clean pair of heels to the field at the Midsummer Mad Dash organised by Valley Hill Runners.  The challenging route of five miles rolls through woodlands around High Green.  At the same race Suzanne McGill ran well to claim the prize for first over40 lady.
