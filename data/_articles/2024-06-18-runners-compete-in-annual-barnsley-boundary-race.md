summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
On one of the worst days for weather this year with temperatures as low as 8 degrees and regular heavy downpours, last Saturday saw the annual running of the Barnsley Boundary Relay Race.  First started over 30 years ago by Barnsley Rockley Rotary Club, the race runs around the 72 mile boundary of Barnsley in 10 separate legs.  It runs adjacent to the boundaries of Sheffield, Kirklees, Wakefield, Doncaster and Rotherham.  Starting at Cannon Hall at 8am the teams ran first to West Bretton and then onwards taking in Brierley, Thurnscoe, Brampton, Tankersley, Wortley, Langsett, Winscar, Upper Denby and back to Cannon Hall.  Marshals and timekeepers coped well in the conditions despite having to write the results down through chattering teeth and numb fingers.  Over £1,850 was raised to help the rotary club’s charity which aims to eradicate polio from the world.  The local running clubs Barnsley AC, Barnsley Harriers, Kingstone, Penistone and Denby Dale were joined by teams from Rotherham RC, Kimberworth, Ackworth and Valley Hill in Sheffield.  And for the first year Stocksbridge Running Club took part.  There was one non-running club: Barnsley Council. 

The men’s race was won by Barnsley AC in a time of 8-03 and their runners won 9 out of the 10 legs. The only exception was George Parr of Penistone who won leg 7. Barnsley AC won the Ladies race in a time of 9-48 and a very competitive Penistone mixed team were first in that class and also 4th overall. Penistone won the men’s over 40 and over 60 as well as the ladies' over 50.  Kingstone won the ladies' over 40 the men’s over 50.  In the competition for non-running clubs the winners were Barnsley Council.  The awards presentation took place at the newly renovated New Inn in Penistone where over 150 people turned out to hear the results and see the presentation of the trophies.  A special award was given to Philip Thompson from the Rotary Club who came up with the original idea of the race and who will be 90 years old this year.

Earlier in the week Penistone had a large contingent of runners in the Joe Percy 10k which is an invitation only event and Penistone were the sole representatives of South Yorkshire in what is an otherwise West Yorkshire team event.  The race is a team competition with 10 runners needed to complete a full team.  Penistone performed very well with their ladies' team placing second and the men’s team picking up third.

Damian Kilpin competed in the latest round of the English Fell running championships at Buttermere Sailbeck.  The race was 9 miles in distance and involved 4,000 feet of ascent.  He got round in 2-07-36 and placed 54th in the men’s over 45 category.

On the parkrun scene there were low numbers due to the Barnsley Boundary race but Flynn Rogers did manage first at Hillsborough Juniors in a new PB of 6-58.  Age graded runs of the week were Dawn Broom (85.54%), Flynn Rogers on Sunday (74.53%), Flynn Rogers on Saturday (73.49%), Sue Hall (73.47%) and Lois Lopez (68.72%).
