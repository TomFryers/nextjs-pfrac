summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
The [Knutsford 10k](https://run-northwest.niftyentries.com/Results/Barclays-Knutsford-10K-2023) acted as a selection race for the England masters running team.  Two Penistone runners earned call-ups thanks to excellent runs.  Dawn Broom, who has already been selected for the England masters half marathon team, earned selection for the 10k team after placing first in the ladies over55 age category in a time of 43-09.  The second runner selected for England was Rachael Mayston who was second in the ladies over50 age category in a time of 42-00. A number of other Penistone runners competed in the race with James Mumford first back in 68th place in a time of 35-14.

Penistone fielded a team in the [Hodgson Brothers Mountain Relay](https://hbmr.org.uk/) in Patterdale in the Lake District.  The team fared well in often quite challenging weather conditions.  The race is made of four legs with two runners on each who must stay together.  The team placed 47th overall and 32nd in the Open category in a time of 4-57-29. Richard Mackie and Steve Storey finished 58th on leg 1 in 55:19, Richard Cottam and James Fryers finished 35th on leg 2 in 82:18, Steve Sanders and Andy Shelbourne finished 53rd on leg 3 in 76:31 and Tom Fryers and George Parr finished 39th on leg 4 in 83:21.  It's the club's best result in this event since 2014.

Three Penistone runners, Kelvin Bowskill, Peter Beever and Mark Graham, competed in the Wickersley Chase trail race on Saturday.

Five Penistone runners competed in the Hopton 10k trail race.  Stand out performance was Stu Smith who claimed first place in the men’s over65 age category in a time of 1-00-53.

On Tuesday night the club held a two mile time trial which will be held every three months.  First back was George Parr in 11-07 and first lady back was Bec Crossland in 14-27.
