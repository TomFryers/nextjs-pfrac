Richard Cottam became the latest Penistone runner to complete the Bob Graham Round, which involves running up and down 42 summits in the Lake District in under 24 hours. He was supported by family and friends and was comfortably inside the 24 hour mark with a finishing time of 22 hours, 17 minutes and 14 seconds.

Earlier in the week the South Yorkshire Road League had its fourth and final fixture at Ingbirchworth. At the end of the race prizes were awarded for overall winners of the race series. Penistone had winners in Martin Ball (men’s over50), Suzanne McGill (ladies over45), Barbara Haigh (ladies over75) and Ray Brown (men’s over80).

A few Penistone runners made the short trip to Wakefield to compete in the Newmillerdam Quacky Trail race 5k.  Both Kelvin Bowskill (men’s over70) and Flynn Rogers (boys under15) picked up age category wins at the race.

Damian Kilpin and Shaun Swallow both had good runs at the [Totley Moor](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/totley-moor) fell race.  PBs were achieved over in Manchester by Rory O’Sullivan (48-57) in the 10k and Gemma Nutton (1-51-09) in the half marathon.
