summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Hard work and consistent training has paved the way to Penistone runner Emma Moore’s current good form.  She recently took part in the York Even Splits 5k and dipped under the 20 minute mark for the first time.  Her time of 19-49 was a new senior ladies [club record](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/records/), beating the previous mark of 20-37 set in 2019 by Sam Shaw.

Three Penistone runners competed in the Treeton Lightning race which is a multi-terrain 4.6 mile race organised by Rotherham Harriers.  First back was Peter Beever in twelfth place overall in a time of 38-18.  Kelvin Bowskill was next in a time of 41-38 and also claimed second place in the men’s over70 age category.

Two runners from the club were in action on the fells around Bakewell taking on the Leg It Round Lathkill Fell Race.  Shaun Swallow finished in a time of 67-45 and Lois Lopez finished in 70-28.

On the [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2024/2024-11-09) scene there were some very impressive performances and also a record number of Penistone runners (76) taking part in parkruns at the weekend.  There were first places for Jade Crosby (Barnsley Parkrun), James Fryers (Town Moor Parkrun in a PB of 16-20) and George Parr (Penistone Parkrun).  Second places for Andrew Pearson (Selby) and Hannah Shaw (Penistone).  Performance of the week was Andrew Pearson at Selby who in the over60 age category completed the 5k route in a time of 17-48.  This gave Andrew an age graded score of 90.07% which is extremely impressive.  Other age graded performances of the week were Dawn Broom (83.55%), Julia Johnson (81.00%), James Fryers (79.80%) and Ian Neville (78.13%).
