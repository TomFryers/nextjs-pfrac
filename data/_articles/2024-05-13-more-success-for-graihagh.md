summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Graihagh Turner, running for Rotherham Harriers in cross country and Penistone Footpath Runners on the fells, picked up the award for best Yorkshire female cross country runner at the weekend and backed it up with some excellent race results.  At the Howgills fell race, near Sedbergh, she finished second place in the under17 category in a high quality field as it was a English Fell Championships race.  On Monday she won the under17 girls category at the Yorkshire Fell Championship race at Coiners, near Halifax.

Penistone runners performed well in hot conditions at the [Furty Furlong](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/championship-2024/furty-furlong) trail race in Mapplewell.  Suzanne McGill was first female and George Parr first male.  There were age category wins for Shaun Swallow (men’s over50) and Lesley Parker (ladies over40 - also second female).

Three Penistone runners braved the heat to take on the Leeds Half Marathon: Sarah Halstead (2-07-35), Rachael Winterbottom (2-09-35) and Jill Scrivens (2-14-41).  Gareth Irvine (19-12) and Rob Lees (19-18) both broke 20 minutes at the Loxley Lash 5k.  For the same distance Rob Davies clocked 20-44 at the York 5k.

The week also saw the first in the [Spencer’s Dash](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/championship-2024/spencers-dash-1) race series.  Podium positions for Penistone runners were Shaun Swallow (first man over50), Suzanne McGill (first lady over45), Oliver Pike (third man over40) and Alan Knox (third man over65).
