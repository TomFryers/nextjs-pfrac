summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Penistone’s men featured strongly in the top finishers at the lumpy Meltham 10k which was run in extremely windy conditions on the hills around Meltham.  Four Penistone men finished inside the top 10.  First back and in third place overall was George Parr in a time of 37-57.  George also placed second in the junior men’s category.  One second behind George in fourth place was Andrew Heppenstall in 37-58 who also picked up second place in the men’s over40 category.  Third place in the men’s over40 category was James Mumford who was also seventh overall in 39-11.  The final Penistone man inside the top ten was Martin Ball in ninth place in 39-27.  Martin picked up first place in the men’s over50 category.  Penistone men’s strong packing gave them first place in the men’s team competition.  Those counting for the team were George Parr, Andrew Heppenstall and James Mumford.  Other prize winners were Barbara Haigh (first over75 lady) and Keith Gordon who was third in the men’s over70 category.

Father and daughter Mark and Heather Graham ventured into the Yorkshire Dales to compete in the Runners and Riders race in which cyclists and runners compete against each other over a 4.7 mile route around Appletreewick. 

On the Parkrun scene there were first places for George Parr at Penistone in 18-17 and Flynn Rogers at the junior parkrun at Hillsborough.
