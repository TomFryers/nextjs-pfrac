"No Home link on top menu" - not doing anything about that at the moment but will keep a count of number of people who mention it: currently 1.

"No Club Records page" - club records are linked to from various places in the website but are not on any menu. Maybe need a holding page (under Competitions probably).  Martyn also previously asked for all the end of year club records to be available. These were static files on the old site but haven't got a place on the new one. If we had a Competitions/Club Records page these would go on here too.
