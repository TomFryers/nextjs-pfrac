summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Five Penistone runners made the trip north to compete in the popular [Brass Monkey Half Marathon](http://www.timingupnorthresults.co.uk/results.aspx?CId=16576&RId=3283) near York.  The race has a reputation for being flat and fast leading to personal bests for the distance.  There was a record turnout of numbers for the race and the weather was perfect for running.  First runner back for Penistone was Andrew Pearson who continues his comeback after a period away from running due to injury.  Andrew placed tenth in the men’s over55 age category in a time of 1-24-59.  Next back was Dawn Broom who had an excellent run to place third in the ladies over55 age category in 1-36-42.  Close behind Dawn was Suzanne McGill whose time of 1-37-42 was enough to reward her with a new [club record](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/records/) for the ladies over45 category.

Also in North Yorkshire, Steve Sanders took part in the [Commondale Clart Fell Race](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2023/commondale-clart).  This challenging but scenic route is just over five miles in distance and involves 722 feet of climbing.  Steve had a strong run to finish 22nd in a field of over 150 runners.  His time was 37-46.

On the [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2024/2024-01-20) scene there was a first place for Flynn Rogers at Hillsborough junior parkrun and a second place for Ashley Firth at Temple Newsam.
