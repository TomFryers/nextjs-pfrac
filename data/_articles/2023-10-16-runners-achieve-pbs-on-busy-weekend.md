summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
It was a busy weekend for the club's runners as they took part in several races across the North of England.  Suzanne McGill claimed a personal best and a club record at the Yorkshire Marathon where she clocked 3-22-56.  This gave her a top ten position in the ladies over45 age category.  Also competing was Michael Walsh who finished in a time of 3-58-26 to get under the four hour barrier.  Second overall in the race was Gary Briscoe from Penistone who competes for Barnsley AC.  Gary claimed a pb in a very rapid 2-26-05.  

The event also saw a shorter 10 mile event.  Ray Brown claimed first place in the men’s over80 age category in 1-40-22.  This knocked 8 minutes off Ray’s own club record for the 10 mile road distance.

James Sidebottom, Rhianna Louise, Chloe Worth and Will Hoyland completed the Ladybower Reservoir 50k Ultra.  They crossed the line together in 7-13-58.  At the same event there was also a 15 mile half marathon race and Heather Graham completed this in 2-56-39.

A good contingent of Penistone runners travelled over the Pennines to compete in the Manchester Half Marathon.  Their trip was rewarded with impressive personal bests for everyone.  Andrew Heppenstall was first back in a time of 1-15-20.  Next was James Mumford in 1-17-07.  Martin Ball followed in 1-20-49, a personal best at the age of 52.  Ashley Firth finished in 1-25-58.  Rob Lees also completed the course in an impressive 1-21-58 just behind Matt Robinson who clocked 1-20-42.

A bit closer to home, four Penistone runners took part in the Holmfirth 10k.  First man back was Rory O’Sullivan in 57-54 and first lady back was Jill Scrivens in 1-01-39.  Three runners headed over to the coast to compete in the Scarborough 10k.  First back was Daniel Hague in 40-10 followed by Mark Graham (49-11) and Peter Beever (49-45).
