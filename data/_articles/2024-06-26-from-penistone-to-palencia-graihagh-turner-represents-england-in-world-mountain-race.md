summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Graihagh Turner represented England at the Under 18 World Mountain Running Championships in Palencia, Spain.  Competing against talent from across the globe, Graihagh put in a great performance to place 15th and was the first English runner to finish.  The England team placed 6th overall.  The amazing fact about Graihagh is that she was competing in the under 18 category and yet hasn’t even turned 16.

Elsewhere it was a busy week for Penistone runners with many races taking place.  Despite biblical downpours in Low Bradfield, home of the annual [Damflask Relays](https://www.sheffieldrunningclub.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Damflask-Relays-Provisional-Results-2024-V3.pdf), there were some good performances from the eleven Penistone teams that took part.  The men’s over50 team of John Broom, Matt Robinson, Tony Wright and Robin Clough managed to pick up a bronze medal.  The ladies over45 team of Chloe Worth, Suzanne McGill and Rachael Mayston went one better to pick up silver.

Sunday saw the annual running of the [Penistone 10k](https://pfrac.co.uk/races/penistone-10k) in hot conditions which made the going tough for many runners.  First back for the home club was Andrew Heppenstall in 6th place in a time of 37-24.  Andrew also picked up third place in the men’s over40 age category.  Suzanne McGill was the first lady back for Penistone in 43-28 which also gave her second place in the ladies over45 age category.  Penistone runners picking up age group podiums were Barbara Haigh (first over75 lady), Tony Wright (first over55 man), Bill Phillips (first over75 man), Lois Lopez (second over50 lady) and Stu Smith (third over65 man).

Midweek saw the running of the [Oughtibridge Chase](http://results.pfrac.co.uk/championship-2024/oughtibridge-chase) and again there was a healthy number of participants from Penistone Footpath Runners who also organise the event.  First lady back for Penistone was Suzanne McGill in 26-30 and twelfth place overall, she also picked up first place in the ladies over40 age category.  George Parr was third overall in 22-20 closely followed by teammate Richard Cottam who was fifth and first over40 man.  There were age category wins for Lois Lopez (over50 ladies), Stu Smith (over60 men), Sue Hall (over60 ladies) and Alan Knox (over70 men).  In the junior race Flynn Rogers had a comfortable win finishing nearly three minutes ahead of his nearest rival.

Peter Beever and Kelvin Bowskill completed the Ulley Reservoir race which is the latest race in the KMR series.  Lorraine Mackie was third over50 lady at the School Run which is part of the Summer Wine Trail series.  It took place near Holmfirth and was 6.7 miles in distance with 1,000 feet of climbing.

Further afield Connor Smith completed the 47km Blue Trail run in Tenerife.  Harriet Drouin took on the very tough Spine Challenger South which was 108 miles in distance and took her 53 hours to complete in very tough weather conditions.

On the [parkrun](http://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2024/2024-06-22) scene Suzanne McGill was first at Penistone and Flynn Rogers first at Hillsborough juniors.  Age graded runs of the week were Dawn Broom (80.00%), Suzanne McGill (78.06%), Kelvin Bowskill (74.90%), Damian Kilpin (74.23%) and John Broom (73.77%).
