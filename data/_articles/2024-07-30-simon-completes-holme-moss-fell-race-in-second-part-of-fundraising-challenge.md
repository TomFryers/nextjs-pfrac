Five Penistone runners made the short journey to Holmfirth to take part in the 17.8 mile [Holme Moss](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/holme-moss) fell race â€“ one of the toughest in the area involving over 4000ft of ascent, made particularly difficult by the hot weather. First back for the club was Tom Fryers in 27th place with a time of 3:55:20, whilst clubmate Chris Hodgson was 3rd in the v50 category with a time of 4:07:27. Damian Kilpin (4:06:01) and Sarah Walch (5:06:39) also ran.

Simon Pike, who has recently begun his 15-part fundraising challenge in aid of Breast Cancer Now, which will culminate with four marathons in seven weeks next year, put in a strong effort to finish in a time of 4:36:37 after completing a triathlon one week prior.

George Parr competed in the [Big Stone](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/big-stone) fell race on Thursday evening, a short but tough course with 1200ft of ascent in just under four miles. He competed well to come home in second place in 30-58, just one second ahead of third.
