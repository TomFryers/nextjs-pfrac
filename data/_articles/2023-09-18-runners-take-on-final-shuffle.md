---
Dawn Broom placed second over55 lady at the Coastal Half Marathon in Cleethorpes on Sunday in 1-37-48.  This was enough to secure qualification to run for the England Masters in the Half Marathon match against Wales in May 2024.

Sarah Walch took on the Hardmoors 60 on Saturday and despite struggling and being on the verge of quitting she managed to hang in and complete the ultra-event in 16-21-00.  Damian Kilpin claimed first over45 man at the Fryup Frazzler Fell Race. 

Thursday saw the final [Silkstone Shuffle](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/championship-2023/silkstone-shuffle-3) trail race of the popular summer series.  This hilly off-road trail race of around 4.5 miles is a three part series event organised by Barnsley Harriers.  Twenty four runners from Penistone Footpath runners took part in the race.  First back for the club in fifth place overall was George Parr in 30-53.  George also picked up bronze in the men’s open age category.  First lady back for the club was in form Suzanne McGill in a time of 36-35.  Ray Brown had a strong run to place first in the men’s over80 age category in 51-07.  In the ladies over70 age category Barbara Haigh took gold in 50-35.

Tuesday night saw the first of the club’s [winter handicap](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/senior-winter-handicap-2023/race-1-race-result) series.  Runners are set off at intervals based on their running ability.  First over the line was Shaun Swallow followed in by Hannah Pedley and Chris Baldwin.  Fastest lady on the night was Suzanne McGill in 33-18 and fastest man was George Parr in 27-43.  Age graded results are also generated with Barbara Haigh gaining the honours.

On the [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2023/latest) scene there were first places for Suzanne McGill at Barnsley, James Mumford at Graves Park and Flynn Rogers at Hillsborough juniors.
