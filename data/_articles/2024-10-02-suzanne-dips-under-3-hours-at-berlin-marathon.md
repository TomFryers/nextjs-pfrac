summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Penistone runner Suzanne McGill paced her marathon to perfection to dip under three hours at the Berlin Marathon.  She finished strongly with a time of 2-59-22, which is an 8 minute improvement on her time at the London Marathon in April.  Suzanne's time broke her own club record (women of all ages) which she set in London earlier this year.  She finished in 19th place in the over45 ladies age category in a marathon which attracts the best runners around the world.

A good number of Penistone runners made the trip to Sheffield on Sunday to compete in the City's 10k race.  First home for the club was Andrew Heppenstall in 34-14 which gave him first place in the competitive men's over40 age category.  Next in for the club and third in the men's over40 age category was Richard Cottam in 34-52.  First lady back was Lois Lopez in 45-58 which was a pb and gave her second place in the ladies over50 age category.

John Broom ran his fastest 10k for seven years at the Knutsford 10k: his finishing time was 40-35.
