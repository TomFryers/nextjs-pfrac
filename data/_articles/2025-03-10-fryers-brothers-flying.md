summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Sunday saw the annual running of the [Ian Roberts](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/ian-roberts-memorial) fell race which starts and finishes in Marsden which is nestled in the foot of the Pennines.  The route is 6.5 miles in distance and covers the challenging local moorland which is boggy and rough.  The final descent involves running through large tussocks of grass and tumbles are inevitable.  There was a contingent of runners from Penistone taking part and their journey to Marsden was a fruitful one.  Tom Fryers took second place in a time of 49-19 and Richard Cottam was fourth in 50-07.  Richard also took first place in the men’s over40 age category.  Damian Kilpin came eleventh and was the third and final counter for the Penistone men’s team which was enough secure second place in the team competition.  Barbara Haigh was second over70 lady and Ray Brown took first place in the men’s over80 age category.

Tom’s brother James claimed fifth place at the [Brough Law](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/brough-law) fell race in Northumberland.  His time of 40-47 gave him top spot in the men’s under21 age category.

On Saturday Simon Pike took on the latest event in his fundraising efforts.  He took part in the gruelling [Haworth Hobble](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/haworth-hobble) fell race which is 32 miles in distance and with a significant amount of climbing.  The race starts and finishes in Haworth, the famous home of the Brontë Sisters.  The route is a mix of trails, moorland and country roads.  Simon completed the race in a time of 6-51-14.  Other Penistone runners completing the race were Harriet Drouin (8-02-01) and Rachel Liptrot (9-18-20).

On the road running front husband and wife John and Dawn Broom competed in the Tameside 5k and both performed well to achieve good times.  John dipped under 20 minutes in 19-51 and Dawn registered 21-57 which gave her second place in the ladies over60 age category.

On the [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2025/2025-03-08) scene, thanks to the good weather there was a record turnout of 82 Penistone runners.  There was a particularly large contingent of 53 Penistone runners at the Penistone parkrun which celebrated its 200th event.  There were first gender places for Jade Crosby (Penistone) and Suzanne McGill (Barnsley).  Second gender places for Andrew Heppenstall (Penistone) and Hannah Shaw (Rother Valley).  Three runners achieved parkrun milestones, they were Jane Cockerton (300th parkrun at Hillsborough), Dianne McGuinness (200th parkrun at Penistone) and Bill Phillips (50th parkrun at Penistone).  Four year old Thom Cottam completed his first ever junior parkrun at Hillsborough finishing in a time of 14-45.  Sister Matilda also competed taking a full minute off her personal best time.  Age graded runs of the week were Andrew Heppenstall (78.66%), Ian Neville (77.41%), Suzanne McGill (21-17), Flynn Rogers (76.61%) and Damian Kilpin (74.38%).
