summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Heather Simpson made the long trip to Kuwait worthwhile grabbing an age group win in the Kuwait City Half Marathon.  She clocked 1-50-08 in the ladies over45 age category.

Slightly closer to home Rachael Mayston put in a strong performance to place third in the ladies over50 age category at the very popular Percy Pud 10k which takes place around the Damflask reservoir just outside of Sheffield.  To put Rachael’s performance into perspective and the size of the event there were 130 other runners in the ladies over50 age category.  Another Penistone runner achieving a top three age category was Bill Phillips who placed third in the men’s over75 age category.  Many Penistone runners took part in the race, which is popular for being a PB course due to its flat route and potential for fast times.  First back for Penistone was Andrew Heppenstall in a time of 34-32.  He place fourth in the men’s over40 age category which consisted of 220 runners.  Second back for Penistone was Flynn Rogers who at the age of 15 recorded a very impressive time of 38-13.  Second lady back for Penistone after Rachael Mayston was Jade Crosby in 43-16.  Another notable performance from a Penistone runner was Richard Docker who placed fifth in the men’s over65 age category.

On the fells six Penistone runners headed to Tintwistle near Glossop to compete in the [Gravy Pud Fell Race](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/bill-fox-gravy-pud).  George Parr had a good run to finish in 13th place overall in a time of 41-30.  First lady back for Penistone was Lesley Parker in a time of 55-23 which also gave her third place in the ladies over45 age category.
