Four runners headed to West Yorkshire to compete in the Spenborough 20 mile race which is an ideal race for those preparing for Spring Marathons such as London and Manchester.  The route is challenging with over 1,500 feet of uphill involved.  First back was Robin Clough in 2-31-41 which was 38th overall and second place in the men’s over55 age category.  Next in was Simon Lovidge (2-39-22) followed by Oliver Found (2-47-22) and Chris Baldwin (2-55-43).
