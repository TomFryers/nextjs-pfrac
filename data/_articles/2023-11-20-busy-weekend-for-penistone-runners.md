summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Penistone runners were in action across the country over the weekend over a variety of distances and surfaces.  The third, and penultimate, South Yorkshire Cross Country fixture took place at a rainy Winterhill in Rotherham.  Ruby Sykes had an excellent run in the ladies open category claiming second place after being in third for a good proportion of the race.  Kai Sunman had a good run in the men’s open race grabbing another top ten finish.  

Three runners made the trip north to take part in the Tadcaster 10 mile road race and all three had excellent runs.  Rachael Mayston’s time of 71-49 was enough to break the ladies over50 [club record](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/records/) for the distance.  Andrew Heppenstall dipped under the hour mark to claim second place in the men’s over40 category in 59-04.  Finally Martin Ball was fourth in the men’s over50 age category in 62-31.

Nine runners took part in the Gainsborough and Morton 10k in Lincolnshire.  First back was Rob Lees in 38-08 which gave him fourth place in the men’s over45 age category.  First lady back for Penistone was Dawn Broom in a time of 44-39 which also gave her fourth place in the ladies over55 age category.  There was a podium finish for Keith Gordon who claimed second place in the men’s over75 age category.  Rory O’Sullivan claimed a PB at the race finishing in 53-20.

David Napier was rewarded with a new personal best after making the trip to London to compete in the Battersea Park Half Marathon.  David’s time of 94-53 knocked four and half minutes off his previous best.  He also place third in the men’s over50 age category.

James Mumford dipped under the 17 minute mark for 5k finishing second male over45 in 16-58 at the Leeds 5k.
