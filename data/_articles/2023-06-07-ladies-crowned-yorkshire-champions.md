summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Three Penistone teams competed in the Yorkshire Veterans Road Relay championships at a very scenic and sunny Cartworth Moor near Holmfirth.  The ladies over45 team came away with gold.  Dawn Broom led off the team of three who each had to take on a three mile course.  She was followed by Rachael Mayston, and Julia Johnson brought home the team in a collective time of 61-16.  Penistone also competed in the men’s over50 category, the team of Martin Ball, Robin Clough and John Broom finishing in 6th place in a time of 56-52.  The men’s over60 team of Richard Docker, Stu Smith and Steve Dommett grabbed fifth place in a time of 71-55.

Dean Allcroft put in an incredible performance to complete the Hardmoors 110.  This is a 110 mile race that takes place in the North York Moors National Park. The course is a challenging route that takes runners through a variety of terrain, including moorland, forest and coastal paths.  Dean completed it in a time of 34-48-21 which gave him 48th place.

On the parkrun scene George Parr claimed first place at the Penistone parkrun in a time of 18-32.  Flynn Rogers was first at the Barnsley junior parkrun in 7-48.  There were second places for Lee Storey (Penistone), Simon Pike (Bestwood) and Tom Fryers (Storeys Field).  In completing the Penistone parkrun Peter Beever notched up 100 parkruns.
