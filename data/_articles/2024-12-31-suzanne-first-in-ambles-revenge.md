summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
On a near perfect day for winter running, the annual Amble's Revenge race took place on Sunday 29th December.  For the 3rd year running it was sold out, with 350 entries.  No gale force winds and heavy rain like last year meant easier conditions for the 8 mile route which starts in Oxspring and heads over farm tracks, fields and country lanes to Green Moor and back.  As there had been little rain for the previous few days there was also no long sections of thick mud to slow down the runners.  There were over 30 marshals on the course encouraging the runners and the winner was from Tonbridge AC: Stuart Brown in a time of 52-42.  The winning lady was from Penistone Footpath Runners: Suzanne McGill in 1-04-31, with Majka Kunicka also of Penistone in third place.  Other local runners who did well were Richard Cottam of Penistone who was 3rd overall, Paul Johnson from Barnsley Harriers who was 4th, and Tom Fryers from Penistone in 5th place. Local age category winners were Barbara Haigh first over70 lady, Stuart Woodhead first over65 man, Steve Frith (Barnsley Harriers) first over70 man and Bill Phillips first over75 man.Lois Lopez claimed second place in the ladies over50 category and Valentina Wright claimed third place in the same category.

On the parkrun scene there were first gender places for Graihagh Turner (Nobles) and Suzanne McGill (Penistone).  There were second gender places for Hannah Shaw (Penistone) and James Mumford (Dewsbury).  Rory O’Sullivan ran his 150th parkrun at Concord.  Age graded runners of the week were Julia Johnson (81.68%), Graihagh Turner (79.41%), Ian Neville (75.53%), Flynn Rogers (75.36%) and James Mumford (74.89%).
