summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
There was little racing over the weekend for runners so parkruns came to the fore with events being run around the region on both Saturday and Christmas day morning.  One of the stand out performance was from junior runner Graihagh Turner who clocked a personal best time of 19-10 at the Penistone parkrun which also gave her first lady back despite being in the ladies under15 age category.

Those from Penistone gaining first places in various age group categories were George Parr (under20 men), Phil Hinchliffe (over50 men), Finn Pepper (under14 boys), Suzanne McGill (under45 women), Rachael Mayston (over50 ladies) and Martyn Cartwright (over75 men) who, in finishing, completed his 100th parkrun.

There was no Penistone parkrun on Christmas Day but the Barnsley parkrun was run on both Saturday and Christmas Day.  At the Saturday event Ruby Sykes placed first lady in 19-13.  Paul Fryers and his sons Tom and James completed both Barnsley parkrun events, James completing his 250th parkrun on the Saturday.  Tom and James impressed in particular on Christmas Day when they placed second and third respectively.  Julia Johnson had an excellent run at the Christmas Day event placing second lady in 22-20.  At the same event there were age group first places for Phil Hinchliffe (over50 men), Patrick Needham (over25 men), Stu Smith (over65 men) and Ray Brown (over80 men).

Keith Gordon completed his 200th different parkrun at the Pavilion Gardens parkrun in Buxton.
