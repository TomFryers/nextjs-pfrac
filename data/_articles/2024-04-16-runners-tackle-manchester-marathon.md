summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
We’re into the Spring marathon season and seven Penistone runners made the trip across the Pennines to compete in the UK’s second most popular marathon, the Manchester Marathon.  England masters international Andrew Pearson put in an excellent performance to clock 2-53-27.  Andrew’s time placed him sixth out of 678 men in the over55 age category.  Dawn Broom went one better claiming fifth place in the ladies over60 age category after running a time of 3-39-30.  Gareth Irvine came close to breaking the three hour barrier with a creditable 3-02-49.  Others completing the challenging 26.2 miles were Matt Robinson (3-10-18), Will Hoyland (3-13-42), Nick Pepper (3-55-24) and Carl Matthewman (4-48-37).

At the Lincoln 10k Shaun Swallow put in his best time for 19 years finishing under 40 minutes in 39-25.  New club member Emma Moore continued her fine form by finishing 2nd at the Steel City Trail 10.

On the fells Tom Fryers did the [Eskdale Elevation](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/eskdale-elevation) fell race in very challenging conditions.  The race required strong navigation skills and many struggled.  Despite this Tom finished in a creditable 25th place and ended up doing more miles and climbing due to some navigation issues.  Many that started the race didn’t complete it.

On the [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2024/2024-04-13) scene there were first places for Suzanne McGill (Penistone), Emma Moore (Stamford Bridge) and Flynn Rogers (Hillsborough Juniors).  George Parr was second at the Penistone Parkrun.  Age graded runners of the week were Suzanne McGill (79.67%), George Parr (75.22%), Bernice Nixon (74.10%), Sue Hall (72.01%) and Keith Gordon (71.92%).
