summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Heather Simpson of Penistone Footpath runners had a strong run at the Morley 10k to pick up third place in the ladies over45 age category in a time of 48-51.  There were a total of 52 runners in the age category.

Penistone fell runner Damien Briscoe, who competes for Dark Peak, completed the Lakes in a Day Ultra which traverses the Lake District, starting at Caldbeck in the north and finishing in Cartmel in the south some 50 miles away.  Despite tough conditions, which led to over 70 competitors failing to complete the race, Damien managed to finish the ultra in a time of  14-48-37.

Dawn and John Broom travelled over to Chesterfield to take part in the No Walk in the Park 5k road race.  John managed to run his fastest 5k time since February 2019, clocking 19-52 on the undulating 4-lap course. This also represented a course best by 33 seconds. John placed first in the men’s over50 age category. Dawn finished second female overall in 21-17, also a course best, for her by 20 seconds.

Every month Penistone nominate a [Parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2023/latest) to attend and for October it was Glossop.  In favourable but slippy conditions fourteen Penistone runners completed the Parkrun and Tom Fryers took first place in 18-05 which was a pb for the course.  Next in for Penistone was Robin Clough in tenth place, who picked up first place in the men’s over50 age category.  Other age group winners were Lisa Hinchliffe (over50 ladies) and Shaun Walker (over55 men).  At Glossop there were Parkrun milestones for Heath Ramsden (100 Parkruns) and Lorraine Mackie (50 Parkruns).  Elsewhere on the Parkrun scene there were first places for Lesley Parker (Castle), Kai Sunman (Rothay Park), Ruby Sykes (Rothay Park) and Lauren Lees (Hillsborough Juniors).
