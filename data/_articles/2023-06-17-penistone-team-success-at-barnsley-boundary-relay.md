summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
On one of the hottest days of the year, with temperatures reaching 27 degrees, last Saturday saw the annual running of the Barnsley Boundary Relay Race. First started over 30 years ago by Barnsley Rockley Rotary Club, the race runs around the 72 mile geographical boundary of Barnsley in 10 legs.  It runs adjacent to the boundaries of Sheffield, Kirklees, Wakefield, Doncaster and Rotherham.  Starting at Cannon Hall at 8am the teams ran first to West Bretton and onwards taking in Brierley, Thurnscoe, Brampton, Tankersley, Wortley, Langsett, Winscar, Upper Denby and finally back to Cannon Hall.  It was a very hot sunny day and this proved challenging for most runners but the dry conditions meant there were some very fast times.  This year over £1,850 was raised to help the Rotary club’s charity which aims at eradicating  polio from the world.

The local running clubs Barnsley AC, Barnsley Harriers, Kingstone, Penistone and Denby Dale were joined by teams from Rotherham, Kimberworth, Ackworth, Team Manvers and Valley Hill in Sheffield.  There were non-running clubs from Barnsley Council and a team called Runners without a cause.  The men’s race was won by Barnsley AC in a time of 8 hours 10 minutes. Penistone won the ladies race and a very competitive Penistone team were winners of the mixed team which was also 2nd overall. Penistone won the men’s over40, over50, over60 and ladies over40 team categories.  Barnsley Harriers won the ladies over50 category.  In the competition for non-running clubs the winners were Runners without a cause with Barnsley Council second.  The presentation took place at the newly renovated New Inn in Penistone where over 150 people turned up to hear the results and see the presentation of the trophies.

Penistone youngsters were in action at the Jack and Paul's fun run.  Flynn Rogers was first in his age category and Grace Williams was second in her age category.

A few Penistone runners competed in the fast Loxley Lash 5k.  Martin Ball broke 18 minutes for the first time.

At the Kimmy Kanter race Kelvin Bowskill claimed first place in the men’s over70 category in a time of 35-12.  Mark Graham also competed finishing in 32-24.
