summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Penistone runners featured well in the Percy Pud 10k road race which attracted 3,000 runners each one getting a Christmas Pudding at the end of the race.  The course is relatively flat and has a reputation as a pb course.  Starting in Loxley the route heads out alongside the damflask reservoir to Low Bradfield before turning back to Loxley.  In awful weather conditions first back for Penistone was George Parr who finished 61st in a new personal best time of 35-15.  He was closely followed by Andrew Heppenstall who finished in 35-27.  First lady back was Rachael Mayston in 43-08.  Rachael also picked up a silver medal in the ladies over50 category.  Over55 man Andrew Pearson picked up gold in his category.  There was a silver medal for Martin Ball (over50 men) and a bronze for Bill Phillips (over70 men).

On the fells Becky Timms picked up a bronze in the ladies over40 category at the Gravy Pud fell race in a time of 50-44.  Steve Storey also picked up bronze in the men’s over65 age category in 52-21.  In the final Peak Raid orienteering event in Baslow Steve Sanders was third in the men’s over50 category and 15th overall.  This gave Steve an overall position of 10th for the series and 3rd over50 man.

On the parkrun scene Lisa Hinchliffe achieved the milestone of 200 parkruns whilst completing the Wakefield parkrun.  Helen Wright was second lady finisher at the Penistone parkrun in 24-42.  Tom Fryers ran the fastest parkrun time by a Penistone athlete this year when completing the Storeys Field event in 17-11.  At the Hillsborough junior parkrun Flynn Rogers had a great run to place first in 8-15.
