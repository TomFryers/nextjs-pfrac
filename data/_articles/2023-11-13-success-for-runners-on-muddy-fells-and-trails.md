summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Steve Sanders scooped second place in the men’s over50 age category at the Wadsworth Half Trog fell race.  Conditions were cold and foggy on a tough 9.3 mile route which takes in the hills around Hebden Bridge.  Overall Steve finished in a creditable 12th place and also managed to clean himself up in a local stream before heading to the pub for a well-earned pint.  Harriet Drouin competed in the Leg It Round Lathkil race which is 7.1 miles in distance and takes place from the peak district village of Over Hadden.  She finished in a time of 1-17-00.  Sarah Walch and Damian Kilpin both picked up second place in their respective age categories at the 12 mile Saltergate Gallows fell race up in the North Yorkshire moors national park.  Damian claimed second in the men’s over45 age category and Sarah was second in the ladies over40 category.

Peter Beaver made the trip to Lytham St Annes to compete in the Windmill Remembrance Day 10k.  In cold, wet and windy conditions Peter got round in a time of 49-55.  Kirsty Salmon, Kate Rushy and Sara Wolstenholme all completed the Rother Valley 10k.

On the [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2023/latest) scene there were first places for Damian Kilpin and Sarah Walch at the Marshal Drive parkrun.  George Parr was second at the Penistone parkrun.  Tom Fryers' time of 16:36 at Storeys Field parkrun is the fastest time for a Penistone runner since 2019.  Notable milestones were Alex Melhuish who completed his 250th parkrun at Penistone and John Broom who completed his 550th at Sherwood Pines.
