summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Perfect conditions for running led to some strong performances at the fast flat Dewsbury 10k.  First back for Penistone was Andrew Heppenstall in 34-12. He was closely followed by Ben Malcolm who recorded a pb of 34-18.  They were rewarded with top 20 places in the men’s over40 category.  Third back was Will Hoyland in 35-12.  Stand out performance came from Andrew Pearson who claimed first place in the men’s over55 age category in a time of 35-49.  Andrew’s time was also a club record.  Matt Robinson claimed fifth place in the same age category in 37-24.  Thirteen Penistone runners in total competed in the event which attracts some of the best athletes in the country due to the possibility of gaining a personal best.

Sarah Walch had an excellent run to claimed third lady at the Saltburn Marathon.  The route is mainly off road and is actually nearly 29 miles in distance.

Rachael Mayston picked up first place in the ladies over45 category at the Chesterfield 5k.  Rachael’s time was 20-38.

At the Cod Beck Canter Damian Kilpin was 12th overall and first in the men’s over45 category.

On the parkrun scene George Parr (18-18) was first at the Penistone Parkrun and James Mumford (18-20) was first at the Dewsbury parkrun.  There were two junior parkrun first places, Lauren Lees (9-13) at Tolson and Monty Hallam (9-32) at Shelley.  Second place at the Tolson junior parkrun went to Lauren’s sister Millie in a time of 9-48.

**Imogen represents GB at cyclocross world champs**

British under 19 champion, Imogen Wolff, of Silkstone Common, and former Penistone Footpath Runners junior, competed for Junior Women Great Britain team at the World Cyclocross championships in Hoogerheide, Netherlands.  For much of the race Imogen was inside the top 20 but due some mechanical issues with her bike finished a creditable 23rd which was 3-37mins behind race winner Isabella Holmgren of Canada.  At just 16, Imogen has a bright and exciting future in cycling.
