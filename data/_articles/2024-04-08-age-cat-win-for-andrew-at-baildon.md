summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
A few Penistone Footpath Runners headed north to compete in the Baildon Boundary run which is a challenging multi-terrain half-marathon that follows the boundary of the old Baildon parish.  First back for the club was Andrew Shelbourne in a time of 1-51-18.  Despite the field having many strong runners Andrew managed to capture first place in the men’s over55 age category.  Next was Mark Law who was fifth in the same age category.  Others completing the course were Phil Hinchliffe, Heather Graham and Mark Graham.

A good number of runners took on the latest round of the English fell championships which was staged locally at the [Lad's Leap](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/alan-kirk-memorial-lads-leap-men) fell race down the road in Crowden, Derbyshire.   The race was 5.9 miles in distance and included 1,700 feet of climbing.    First back in the high quality field was George Parr in 88th place in a time of 57-16.  Others competing were Damian Kilpin and [Helen Wright](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/alan-kirk-memorial-lads-leap-women).

The South Yorkshire 5 mile Road League kicked off at Elsecar on a breezy Wednesday night and there was a healthy turnout of runners from Penistone.  First lady back for Penistone was Suzanne McGill who claimed second place in the ladies over45 age category.  First man back was Andrew Heppenstall who placed third in the men’s over40 age category.  There were age group wins for Martin Ball (men’s over50), Barbara Haigh (ladies over75) and Ray Brown (men’s over80).

Monday night also saw the start of the popular [Trunce](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/trunce-1) race series which involves a four mile run on trails around Oxspring.  Uniquely the race also involves three river crossings which were made all the more challenging due to the high recent rainfall.  George Parr grabbed a creditable third place in a time of 26-58 which was quick given the tough conditions.  There were podium places for Barbara Haigh (first over70 lady), Damian Kilpin (third over40 man) and Alan Knox (third over70 man).

Joanne Boreham made the trip to France to compete in the Paris marathon.  She completed the 26.2 miles in 4-24-36.  Afterwards Jo said that this was her first but last road marathon!

On the [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2024/2024-04-06) scene there were first places for Suzanne McGill (Penistone) and Flynn Rogers (Hillsborough Juniors).  Richard Cottam was second at Penistone.  Three generations of Storeys competed in the Penistone parkrun to mark Joseph Storey’s 100th parkrun.  Other runners achieving milestones were Oliver France (100 parkruns), Ashley Firth (100 parkruns) and Emma Stead (50 parkruns).  Age graded runners of the week were Dawn Broom (89.13%), Suzanne McGill (82.16%), John Broom (75.85%), Bill Phillips (73.12%) and Gareth Irvine (72.63%).
