---
Penistone Footpath Runner Tom Fryers enjoyed a festive parkrun double with first places at the Temple Newsam parkrun on Saturday followed up by first place at the Christmas Day parkrun at Barnsley.  The first place at Temple Newsam was all the more remarkable given Tom cycled to the event from his home in Oxspring on a mountain bike, a distance of 27 miles.

Elsewhere on the parkrun scene there was a very quick run by Hugh Mackie who dipped under 16 minutes at the Doddington Hall event. Hugh’s time of 15-51 gave him second place.  At the Penistone parkrun Suzanne McGill was first lady and George Parr placed second in the men’s.  Flynn Rogers captured first place at the Hillsborough junior parkrun. At the Hull parkrun Dawn Broom was third lady out of a field of 210 ladies. In terms of milestones Rory O’Sullivan completed his 100th parkrun and Jane Cockerton finished her 250th.
