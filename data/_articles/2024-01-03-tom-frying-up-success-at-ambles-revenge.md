summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Tom Fryers' current good form continued as he comfortably won the [Amble's Revenge](https://pfrac.co.uk/races/ambles-revenge) trail race, held midway between Christmas and New Year.  Conditions were tough for the 275 runners that completed the hilly and demanding eight mile course which traverses the Hunshelf boundary near Stocksbridge.  The route is a mix of woodland, cross country and quiet country lanes.  Tom’s time of 55-50 was half a minute in front of his nearest rival.  There was further success for Penistone with Suzanne McGill picking up first place in the ladies over45 age category, Bill Phillips claiming top spot in the men’s over75 age group and Barbara Haigh grabbing gold in the ladies over75 age category.  There were further podium positions for Keith Gordon (second over75 man), Heather Lindley (third over60 lady) and Robin Clough (third over50 man).

On the fells Steve Sanders completed the [Stoop](http://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2023/the-stoop) fell race at Haworth in 42-28 which gave him 34th place in the field of 149 runners.

On the parkrun scene it was a busy period with additional parkruns being held on New Year’s Day.  [Saturday](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2023/2023-12-30) saw Graihagh Turner take first place at the Hillsborough parkrun.  Suzanne McGill picked up second place at the Brickfield parkrun in Dublin.  A number of parkrun milestones were achieved by David Needham (400), Tom Fryers (300) and Sarah Clough (100).  On [New Year's Day](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2024/2024-01-01) Andrew Heppenstall notched up his 50th parkrun at Barnsley.
