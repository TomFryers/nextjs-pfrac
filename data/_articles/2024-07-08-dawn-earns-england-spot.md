summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Penistone runner Dawn Broom competed in the Great North 10k in Newcastle and her time of 46-22 entitled her to represent England Masters at the 10k distance next year in the ladies over60 age category.

Will Hoyland, Chloe Worth and Rhianna Bamford took part in the Endure 24 event in Leeds which involves running as many 8k laps as possible within 24 hours.  Competing in the small team mixed category they managed an impressive 33 laps which gave them an overall 30th out of 807 teams and a category position of 5th out of 75 teams.

Bill Phillips broke the [club 5k record](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/records/) for men over75 at the Loxley Lash where he clocked 25-31.

Three Penistone runners completed the Hillybank Eccup 10 mile race.  First back for the club was Michael Nicholson in 1-21-45 followed by Peter Beever (1-20-30) and Lois Lopez (1-21-45).

Penistone was well represented at the [Thurlstone Chase](https://pfrac.co.uk/races/thurlstone-chase) on Saturday.  First back for the club in 5th place overall was Dan Rushforth.  Close on his heels was Suzanne McGill who not only finished 6th overall but was also the fastest lady, clocking 30-44.

On the parkrun scene Emma Moore led the charge, finishing as the first female at Frickley with a time of 22-33, while Flynn Rogers secured first place at Hillsborough juniors with 06-54. George Parr and Suzanne McGill both achieved second places at Penistone, with McGill earning the highest age-graded score of the weekend at 82.11%. The top age-graded performances were rounded out by Shaun Swallow at Penistone (76.23%), Flynn Rogers at Hillsborough juniors (75.25%), George Parr at Penistone (74.93%), and Dawn Broom at Wynyard Woodland (74.89%). Other notable performances included personal bests from Shaun Swallow at Penistone (19-59) and Michael Nicholson at Millhouses (24-11). Flynn's junior parkrun was his 126th and final junior event, as he will be too old next week!  His contribution to the Hillsborough parkrun community was deservedly recognised with a presentation at the event.
