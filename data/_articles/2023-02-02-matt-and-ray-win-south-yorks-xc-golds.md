summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Penistone runners featured strongly in the rescheduled fourth fixture of the South Yorkshire Cross Country league at Longley Park in Sheffield.  The fixture also doubled up as the South Yorkshire cross country championships.  Stand out performance was from Matt Robinson who claimed first place in the men’s over55 category in a time of 43-47.  Another first place went to Ray Brown in the men’s over80 category.  Ruby Sykes was fourth in the senior ladies race and also finished fourth overall in the series.  Ruby’s time was 22-55.  Another fourth place went to George Parr in the men’s under20 event.  In the junior races Tadek Kunicka-Holda was third in the boys under15 category in 15-15.

Elsewhere James Fryers had a great run to claim fourth place at the Kirkharle Shepherd’s Trail half marathon, he was also first in the men’s under20 category.  Conditions were icy on the hilly Northumberland course and James could have finished higher overall but slipped on the ice with 2 kilometres to go.

On the parkrun scene Flynn Rogers put in a great performance to be first finisher at the Malvern junior parkrun in a time of 7-39.
