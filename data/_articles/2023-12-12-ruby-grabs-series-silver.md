summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
The rescheduled Percy Pud 10k again fell victim to the weather, this time due to high winds.  So the focus of attention switched to the final fixture in the South Yorkshire Cross Country league which took place at a muddy Graves Park in Sheffield.  Ruby Sykes' fourth place in the senior ladies cemented her consistent form across the series and rewarded her with silver for the overall series.  Kai Sunman also finished highly to give him a top ten place in the series.

The Penistone men’s team ran consistently across the series and should retain their division one status in the league for next year.  On the day there was success also for Barbara Haigh (first over75 lady), Keith Gordon (first over75 man) and Ray Brown (first over80 man).  In the junior races Heidi Morley finished a creditable 15th in the girls under11 race.

James Mumford ran strongly to finish second in the men’s over40 age category at the Stockport 10 mile race.  He finished 33rd overall in 1-01-15.  The race was run in wet and windy conditions and included a 1.5 mile off road section on farm tracks.

The penultimate [winter handicap](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/senior-winter-handicap-2023/race-5-race-result) took place around the hills of Penistone on an icy Tuesday night.  Matthew Coldwell claimed the overall victory in the handicapped race.  Fastest lady on the night was Suzanne McGill and fastest man was George Parr.  George also claimed first spot in the age graded times, just edging out Barbara Haigh.

Two Penistone runners competed in the Bah Humbug 10k which takes place in South Leeds.  Alex Melhuish was first back in 51-26 followed by Peter Beever in 58-09.

On the [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2023/2023-12-09) scene Dawn Broom was first at The Old Railway Track parkrun in Llangollen.  Ashley Firth was placed second at the Rothwell parkrun, as was Oliver France at Penistone.
