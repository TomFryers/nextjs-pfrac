Penistone ladies packed well to take first ladies team at the [Travellers 6](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/championship-2024/travellers-6) road race held around the undulating windswept roads of Denby Dale on Sunday.  The three counters were Suzanne McGill, Jade Crosby and Lois Lopez.  As the race was a Penistone club championship race their numbers were significant, with 31 taking part.  First runner back for Penistone was James Fryers in an impressive fifth place overall.  There were several age group winners: Suzanne McGill (first over45 lady), Lois Lopez (first over50 lady), Bill Phillips (first over75 man), Barbara Haigh (first over75 lady).

The final South Yorkshire Cross Country league fixture took place at Graves Park in Sheffield.  Several Penistone runners of all ages took part.  Heidi Morley placed 13th in the under11 girls and Flynn Rogers was 8th in the men’s under17 race.  There were strong runs also from Jemma Williams (over35 ladies), Andrew Shelbourne (over55 men), Gareth Irvine (over45 men), Mark Law (over55 men), Martyn Goodwin (over65 men) and Nick Whittingham (over70 men).

Husband and wife John and Dawn Broom took part in the Telford 10k which is recognised as one of the fastest in the country. Dawn took second place in the ladies over60 age category in a time of 44-30.  John maintained his recent good form to record 41-30.
