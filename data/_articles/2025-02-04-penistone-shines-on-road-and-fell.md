summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
The weather was much improved at the weekend and there was an action-packed number of races in which Penistone runners were involved. The Dewsbury 10k is well known as a good local race that is flat and conducive to fast times. Twenty-seven Penistone runners completed the race, many achieving personal best times. First back for Penistone was Martin Ball, who finished 7th in the men’s over50 age category, which had a field of 192 runners. Andrew Pearson just missed out on winning the men’s over60 age category, taking second place in a time of 36-57, which is a remarkable time for an over60 runner. Keith Gordon went one better, taking first place in the men’s over75 age category in 51-18. First lady back for Penistone was Jade Crosby in 41-35. Gemma Nutton continued her fine form with a two-minute personal best in 46-08. Peter Beever’s time of 45-42 also represented a new personal best for the 10k distance.

Good weather conditions were welcome at the [Mickledon Straddle](http://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/mickleden-straddle) fell race, which returned after a five-year absence. The route covers 14.3 miles, starting in Langsett and heading out up Mickledon Edger towards Howden Reservoir before heading back along the notoriously tough Howden Clough. Twelve runners from Penistone completed the race, with George Parr first back in nineteenth place in a time of 2-02-09. First lady back for the club was Lesley Parker in 2-33-56. There were top age group performances from George Parr (3rd under23 man) and Nick Whittingham (2nd over70 man). Mark Law grabbed top spot in the men’s over60 age category in a time of 2-24-43, which was eight minutes ahead of his closest rival.

Also on the fells, new club members Dave Lovatt and Brent Carlin completed the [Tigger Tor](http://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/tigger-tor) fell race. Brent was first back out of the pair in 35th place, followed by Dave in 135th.

Dawn and John Broom put in impressive performances at the No Walk in the Park 5k. Dawn was first in the ladies over55 age category in 21-46, and John was second in the men’s over50 age category in 19-51.

On the [Parkrun](http://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2025/2025-02-01) scene, there were first-gender places for Richard Cottam (Concord) and Suzanne McGill (Penistone). There were second gender places for James Fryers (Jesmond Dene) and Julia Johnson (Nostell), and a third-place gender finish for Hannah Shaw (Penistone). Age-graded runners of the week were Julia Johnson (83.29%), Suzanne McGill (79.58%), Richard Cottam (78.69%), Ian Neville (77.62%), and Bill Phillips (73.00%).
