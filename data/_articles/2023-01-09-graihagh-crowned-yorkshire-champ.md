summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
The Yorkshire cross country championships were held in wet and windy conditions at Lightwater Valley in North Yorkshire at the weekend.  Penistone athlete Graihagh Turner, who competes for Rotherham for cross country, won the under15 girls category in a time of 16-29.  Her Rotherham teammates packed well meaning she also picked up a team gold medal.  The result means that Graihagh will more than likely be selected to compete for Yorkshire at the Inter County championships later in the year.

The notoriously tough Trigger fell race took place on Sunday and a number of Penistone athletes took on and completed the race which starts in Marsden in West Yorkshire and finishes in Edale in Derbyshire.  The 23 mile route is completely off road and requires good navigation skills to avoid getting lost on the Yorkshire and Derbyshire fells.  First back for Penistone and inside the top ten in eighth place was Phil Montgomery.  Next back was Damien Briscoe.  Other Penistone runners finishing were Peter Gray, Sarah Walch, Matt Womersley, Chris Hodgson and Nick Whittingham.

Elsewhere some Penistone runners took on the Round Sheffield Run.  Lesley Parker claimed sixth place in the ladies over40 category in a time of 1-42-22.  Another top ten finisher was Jonathan Bentley who was 8th in the men’s over50 category in 1-29-03.

On the parkrun scene there were first places for James Mumford in Halifax, Julia Johnson in Amsterdam and George Parr at Penistone.
