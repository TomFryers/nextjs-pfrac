summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
After nine years of preparation and planning Penistone runner Damien Briscoe completed the notoriously tough Bob Graham Round challenge at the weekend.  The challenge involves traversing a circuit of 42 peaks within a 24 hour period covering 66 miles and a total of 27,000 feet of climbing.  Damien completed the challenge in 23 hours and 36 minutes and was supported by a group of family and friends along the way.  Damien described the challenge as the hardest thing he had done in his life.

Closer to home it was a busy week of racing with three races taking place during the week.  Monday saw the [second of the Trunce series](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/trunce-2) take place near Oxspring.  Penistone performed well with notable performances from George Parr (2nd overall and 2nd in male category), Alan Knox (2nd over70 man), Lesley Parker (3rd over40 lady) and Finn Pepper (3rd in the junior race).

Wednesday saw the [Hartcliff Hill](https://pfrac.co.uk/static/results/hartcliff-hill/hartcliff-2024-results.pdf) race take place over a new route around Hartcliff near Langsett.  George Parr followed up his second place in the Trunce with another second place behind winner Phil Montgomery.

On Thursday the year’s first [Silkstone Shuffle](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/championship-2024/silkstone-shuffle-1) took place and Suzanne McGill showed she had recovered well from the London Marathon to grab first place in the ladies race. Damian Kilpin fared well in the men’s race picking up third place and teammate Dan Hague was not far behind in 5th.

Dean Allcroft completed the 44 mile Wolds Rangers Way in a time of just over nine hours to give him 31st place in a field of 90 starters.

On the [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2024/2024-04-27) scene there were first places for James Fryers (Jesmond Dean), George Parr (Penistone) and Suzanne McGill (Penistone).  Age graded runners of the week were Dawn Broom (90.61%), Suzanne McGill (80.00%), John Broom (77.13%), Rachael Mayston (76.71%) and George Parr (75.44%).
