summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
With little activity due to the harsh weather over the last week, a mere 11 Penistone runners were out competing in Parkruns at the weekend.  Jill Scrivens travelled to Leeds to participate in the Roundhay Park event, finishing her 150th Parkrun in 32:31, joined by clubmates John & Jane Lawcock and Mandy Mallinder. Meanwhile, Keith Gordon travelled north of the border into Scotland to complete Crichton Parkrun in Dumfries, getting round in 26:56. Topping the age-graded charts this week was Dawn Broom with just over 81%, thanks to a 23:42 effort at Sherwood Pines Parkrun.

Before the snow hit, Mary Ferguson competed in the Tatton Park 10k, earning herself a PB with a finishing time of 52:53.
