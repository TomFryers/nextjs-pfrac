summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
The ever impressive Andrew Pearson had a storming run at the Snake Lane 10 mile road race.  He claimed first place in the men’s over60 age category which had a field of 78 runners and his time of 1-04-01 was enough to break the [club over60 record](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/records/) by over three minutes.  There were three other Penistone runners taking on the well-established 10-mile race which is held in Pocklington in the East Riding of Yorkshire and is renowned for being relatively flat and fast making it ideal for runners preparing for Spring marathons.  The three were Shaun Swallow (1-10-53), Rob Davies (1-15-32) and Nick Whittingham (1-38-00).

Three hardy runners took on the challenging [Doctors Gate](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/doctors-gate) fell race which is 12.7 miles in distance coupled with 3,300 feet of ascent.  The course traces the historic packhorse route from Old Glossop to its junction with the Pennine Way, ascending to landmarks such as Higher Shelf Stones and Lower Shelf Stones.  Those completing the route were Jon Hallam (2-36-59), Simon Pike (2-40-07) and Chris Hodgson (2-44-51).

Steve Owen ventured over to Stockport to compete in the Stockport Trail Half Marathon.  He placed fourth in the men’s over55 age category in a new personal best time of 1-45-53.
