summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
The second fixture of the South Yorkshire Cross Country League took place at Longley Park in Sheffield.  Persistent rain in the run up to the race meant conditions were particularly muddy underfoot.  On the day though the weather was unseasonably warm and the runners were besieged by a swarm of ladybirds during the event.  In the ladies race Ruby Sykes kept her good form with a third place to follow up her second place in the first fixture. Next in was Majka Kunicka who again performed well in the ladies over35 age category.  In the men’s race Kai Sunman had a strong last lap to leap from eighth place to fourth place.  Next back was George Parr.

Three Penistone runners made the trip to Worksop to compete in the Halloween Half Marathon.  Nick Pepper was first back in a time of 1-46-21 followed by Chloe Worth (1-52-45) and Sarah Halstead (2-11-44).

Sarah Walch and Damian Kilpin completed the Lockton Limping fell race, conditions were muddy on the seven mile route which involves 1,140 feet of climbing.

On the [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2023/latest) scene George Parr placed first at Penistone in a time of 18-10.  It also represented George’s 100th parkrun.  There were second places for James Fryers (Town Moor), whose time, 16-45, was a PB and the fastest parkrun time of any Penistone runner for over 2 years, Rob Lees (Doddington Hall), Julia Johnson (Dewsbury) and Suzanne McGill (Penistone).
