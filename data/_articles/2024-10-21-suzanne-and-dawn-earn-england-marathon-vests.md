summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Penistone runner Suzanne McGill became the latest runner from the club to earn an England master’s vest.  She will be able to compete for England by virtue of coming second in her age category at the Yorkshire Marathon which was held in blustery conditions on Sunday.  Suzanne was second in the ladies over45 age category in a time of 3-03-08, just slightly slower than her recent sub 3 hour pb at Berlin.  Fellow England masters runner, Dawn Broom, also had a good run finishing third in the ladies over60 age category in 3-37-56 which also earns her selection to compete for England masters at the marathon distance and a new [club record](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/records/).  Also running was Michael Walsh who dipped under four hours, finishing in 3-55-23.

Sitting alongside the marathon was also a 10 mile race which several Penistone runners took on.  First back was James Mumford in 1-00-48 which gave him fourth place in the men’s over40 age category.  First lady back was Gemma Nutton in 1-25-14.

Three Penistone runners made the trip to the east coast to compete in the Scarborough 10k.  Michael Nicholson was first back for the club in 46-00 followed by Peter Beever (47-06) and Andrea Henson (53-24).  Shaun Swallow had a good run at the Langdale Half Marathon finishing in 1-41-31.  

Saturday saw Penistone enter three teams into the [British Fell and Hill Relay Championships](https://www.sportident.co.uk/results/Wharfedale/2024/BritishFellRelay/), which took place in Appletreewick in the Yorkshire Dales.  The men’s open team of Hugh Mackie, James Fryers, Richard Cottam, Tom Fryers, George Parr and Daniel Rushforth came 43rd overall and 31st in their category.  The ladies over40 team of Emily Freeman, Emma Stead, Jemma Williams, Sarah Walch, Helen Wright and Joanne Boreham were 129th overall and 12th in their category.  The final team was the men’s over40 team of Martyn Goodwin, Simon Pike, Chris Hodgson, Andy Shelbourne, Steve Sanders and Mark Graham who were 103rd overall and 13th in their age category.

Despite running in the fell relays on Saturday, George Parr managed a creditable fourth place at the [Gormire Gamble](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/gormire-gamble) fell race which took place in Thirsk the following day.
