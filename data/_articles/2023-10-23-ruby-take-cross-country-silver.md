summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Penistone had strong representation at the first fixture in the South Yorkshire Cross Country League at Clifton Park in Rotherham.  The standout performance came from Ruby Sykes who claimed 2nd place in the senior ladies race.  Team mate Majka Kunicka had a good run to finish 11th overall and 3rd in the ladies over35 age category.  Kai Sunman had a strong run to place 4th in the men’s race.  Heidi Morley claimed 9th place in the girls under11 race in a time of 7-29.  Alex Wright placed 7th in the boys under13 race in 16-28.

T﻿he club entered three teams in the British Fell and Hill Relay Championships at Braithwaite, near Keswick in the Lake District.  Despite the adverse weather conditions caused by Storm Babet the Lake District surprisingly enjoyed good conditions for the event.  The teams entered were men’s open, ladies' over40 and men’s over50.  Standards were very high at the event with many of the best fell runners in Britain assembled.  Hugh Mackie had a great run on leg one to put the men’s open team in 17th place in a time of 30:18.  The teams competed well on some very challenging routes strewn with mud, heather and rocks.

Dawn Broom finished first lady in the over55 category at the Abingdon Marathon.  Despite falling down at 21 miles Dawn managed to complete the course in an impressive 3-31-43.  Many parkruns were cancelled around the region due to Storm Babet.  Flynn Rogers was first at the Hillsborough junior parkrun and Lauren Lees claimed second girl at the same event.  Lee Hopkins notched up his 450th parkrun at Lytham Hall.
