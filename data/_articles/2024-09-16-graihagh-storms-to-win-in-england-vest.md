Penistone runner Graihagh Turner put in an amazing performance to win the girls under17 home international in Ireland yesterday.  She was competing for England against the other home nations and her win also helped England to team gold.

Monday saw the [final race](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/trunce-9) of the Trunce series which takes place over the summer.  There were series wins for Alan Knox (over70 men), Sarah Walch (over40 ladies) and Barbara Haigh (over70 ladies).  Podium finishes were achieved by George Parr (second overall man), Helen Wright (third over40 lady) and Lois Lopez (third over50 lady).  Special mention to Andy Plummer who steps down as organiser of the Trunce race after many years in the role.

Six Penistone runners competed in the [Stanage Struggle](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/fat-boys-stanage-struggle) fell race.  Richard Cottam was first back in sixth place overall and also picked up first place in the men's over40 age category.  Sarah Walch was first lady back for Penistone in 98th place overall.

Peter Beever and Kelvin Bowskill competed in the Treeton Bolt Race.  Kelvin had a good run to claim first place in the men's over70 age category in a time of 37-02.  Nick Whittingham and Gareth Irvine completed the Worrall Festival Chase.  Nick captured first place in the men's over70 age category.

Steve Sanders was 20th in the Lake District Mountain Trial navigational event.  He completed the medium course in a time of 5-47, covering a distance of 20 miles.

Dawn Broom claimed first place in the ladies over60 age category at the Lake Vyrnwy half marathon in a time of 1-38-31.

Harriet Drouin ran 42 miles as part of a fundraising event for her friend's charity.  In a weekend of long runs Damien Briscoe claimed second place in the men's over40 50 kilometre ultra X in Edale.  The event was plagued with bad weather and many pulled out.  His finishing time was 6-33-36.  Lesley Parker ran 47 miles whilst undertaking 'The Lap' which takes in the fells around a loop of Lake Windermere in the Lake District.  She completed the race, which involves 8,300 feet of ascent, in 12 hours 43 minutes.  Her placing was 147th out of 572 finishers.  A further 200 failed to finish due to the severity of the weather and the toughness of the event.

Gemma Nutton and Jill Scrivens made the trip to Cleethorpes to compete in the Humberside 10k.  Both had good runs with Gemma finishing in a time of 51-46 and Jill in 57-52.
