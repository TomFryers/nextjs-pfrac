summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Penistone based runner Graihagh Turner, competing for Rotherham Harriers, claimed third place at the Yorkshire Cross Country championships which were held at Lightwater Valley near Ripon.  Competing in the under17 woman’s category Graihagh finished in a time of 17-00.  Finishing in third should almost guarantee selection for Graihagh for the Yorkshire Cross Country team which will compete in the Inter County Championships later in the year.

Running events were affected by the wintery weather conditions over the weekend including the cancellation of the popular Round Sheffield Run event.  Seven Penistone runners competed in the [Wormstones](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/wormstones) five mile fell race on New Year’s Eve.  George Parr claimed a top ten finish coming in seventh place in a time of 37-55.  First lady back for Penistone was Lesley Parker in 49-05.

Penistone [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2025/2025-01-04) was cancelled but the sterling efforts of the volunteers at Barnsley ensured the event went ahead despite icy conditions.  First lady at the Barnsley parkrun was Penistone's Suzanne McGill in 22-25.  Lesley Parker was first lady at Concord in 23-43.  There were second places for Emma Stead (Cusworth Hall) and Tom Fryers (Sheffield Castle).  Alan Knox ran his 100th parkrun at Barnsley.  Age graded runners of the week were Dawn Broom (81.07%), Ian Neville (76.75%), Suzanne McGill (73.01%), John Broom (72.89%) and Robin Clough (72.37%).
