summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Penistone runner Peter Beever made the trip into Lancashire to compete in the Take the Fell 10k.  His journey was made worthwhile as he picked up first place in the menâ€™s over50 age category in a time of 1-06-47.  Not a pb course, the route consisted of a mix of muddy and uneven trails.  Another Penistone runner making a long trip was Andrew Pearson who made the trip down the M1 to compete in the Leicester 10k.  Normally a certainty to win his age category Andrew was slightly lower down the field as there was no over55 age category which meant he was in the over50 category and competing with runners several years younger than him.  He was still inside the top ten for his age category finishing in ninth place in a time of 37-04.  Overall he was in 50th place in a field of 1,000 runners.

Harriet Drouin showed great grit and determination to complete the [Saddleworth Ten Res's](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2023/saddleworth-ten-reses), which is a challenging 26 mile fell running race.  The route takes in a scenic loop around Saddleworth Moor, visiting 10 local reservoirs along the way.  Conditions were incredibly tough due to heavy snow fall in the area.  Many runners pulled out but Harriet managed to complete the course in just over seven hours.  She kindly assisted an injured runner over the final six miles of the race.

On the [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2024/2024-03-02) scene there were first places for Kai Sunman, Ruby Sykes (both Hillsborough), Suzanne McGill (Penistone) and Flynn Rogers (Hillsborough Juniors).  James Mumford picked up third place at the Huddersfield parkrun in 17-40. Dianne McGuinness completed her 150th parkrun at Keswick.  Age graded performances of the weekend were Ruby Sykes (82.76%), Kai Sunman (80.71%), James Mumford (79.06%), Suzanne McGill (74.88%) and Damian Kilpin (73.85%).
