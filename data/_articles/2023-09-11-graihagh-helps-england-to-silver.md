Penistone athlete Graihagh Turner, representing England in the girls under17 age category, placed fifth overall and was second home for England helping them take the silver team medal.

The final [Trunce](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2023/trunce-9) took place last Monday in warm conditions.  As it was the final race, fancy dress was encouraged.   Penistone claimed a one two with Tom Fryers claiming first place ahead of teammate George Parr.  There were age group wins for Richard Cottan (men’s over40), Majka Kunicka (ladies over40) and Barabara Haigh (ladies over70).  Series winners will be announced at the Trunce presentation night on 18th September.

A few Penistone runners took on the [Bleaklow Blitz](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2023/bleaklow-blitz), which is an eight mile fell race that takes place near Torside and follows the Pennine Way all the way up to Bleaklow Head and then back down.  Penistone were well represented in the first ten finishers with Damien Kilpin picking up fifth and George Parr not far behind in seventh.  This strong packing gave Penistone first place in the men’s team prize.  First lady back for Penistone was Sarah Walch, who was fourth lady back, followed by Becky Timms, who was seventh lady.
