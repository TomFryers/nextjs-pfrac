summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
On a quiet weekend for racing, Saturday morning parkruns took centre stage.  The numbers at the Barnsley parkrun were higher than usual due to the cancellation of the Penistone parkrun.  Lisa Hinchliffe was one of those taking part and it also happened to be Lisa’s 250th parkrun.  After finishing Lisa said “I made it round my 250th parkrun today. Thank you [Barnsley parkrun](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1678630439066947/user/100063598507969/?__cft__%5b0%5d=AZUpIOKex5yO89mCd1iMyTNbQi8rEala4yCs53toLMquopFDxpn09wcozBTGFIX2KAu_SwsaW1CMnPpQzk-dvl4KcBj_0NUhjv67tcJe2VROr-D9A3hMA5WtOmrvRUP8I_oiqjY48HaLXhfrdmmLsf1G3QrGrk0jf9cx0CHBLdUDwiJyvrsF7A971wDqqxO8URs&__tn__=-%5dK-R)! It's definitely getting much harder!” Penistone runners fared well, taking the first three spots at Barnsley.  Tom Fryers was first back in 17-21 followed by George Parr (17-56) and James Mumford (18-20).  Not to be outdone, Penistone juniors Lauren (9-25) and Millie Lees (9-32) took first and second place at the Barnsley junior parkrun.  This was also Lauren’s 50th time participating in the junior parkrun.  The best age graded runners at parkruns over the weekend were Julia Johnson (82.15%), Rachael Mayston (80.41%), James Mumford (76.18%), Tom Fryers (74.64%) and Sue Hall (73.34%).
