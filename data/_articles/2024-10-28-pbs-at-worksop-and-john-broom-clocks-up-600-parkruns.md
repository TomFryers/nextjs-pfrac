summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Eleven Penistone Footpath Runners made the trip to Worksop in Nottinghamshire to compete in the town’s popular half marathon road race.  The course is fast and flat, making it good for achieving personal best times.  Oliver Pike was first back for the club in a time of 1-30-53 followed by Emma Moore who achieved a new personal best time of 1-32-06.  This also gave Emma fifth place in the senior women’s age category which is a creditable achievement given the quality of the field.  There were also personal bests for Michael Nicholson (1-41-59) and Carl Matthewman (1-57-49).

On the fells Damian Kilpin made a comeback from injury competing in the [Lockton Limping](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2024/lockton-limping) fell race in North Yorkshire.  He finished just outside the top 30 in a time of 1-02-00.

The second South Yorkshire Cross Country league meeting took place at Longley Park in Sheffield.  There were lots of good runs from Penistone runners in varying age categories but results have yet to be released.

The club held its [third winter handicap](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/senior-winter-handicap-2024/race-3-race-result) race on Thursday night.  First in the handicap competition was Kim Rogers followed by Andrew Taylor and Jackie Howsham.  Fastest lady on the night was Jade Crosby (34-03) and fastest man George Parr (26-41).  Age-adjusted times show Ian Neville as best performance based on age followed by Barbara Haigh in second.

On the [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2024/2024-10-26) scene there were first places for Emma Moore (Barnsley) and Lesley Parker (Concord).
