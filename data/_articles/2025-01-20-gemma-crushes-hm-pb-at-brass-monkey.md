summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Fast improving Penistone runner Gemma Nutton beat her previous half marathon pb by 5 minutes at the Brass Monkey Half Marathon.  The weather again affected racing over the weekend but the famous race in York, which attracts over 1,700 runners, went ahead despite sub zero temperatures.  Gemma made light of the conditions to finish in a time of 1-43-52.

The Barnsley [parkrun](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2025/2025-01-18) was cancelled, which meant there were well over 200 runners at the Penistone parkrun which was given the green light to go ahead.  A fifth of the field of runners were from Penistone Footpath runners running club.  Suzanne McGill took first lady in a time of 20-55 and George Parr was second man in 17-12.  There were course pbs for Tom Fryers (17-20), Hannah Shaw (21-22),  Dan Canetti (22-56), and Sue Hall (29-20).  At other parkruns there were first places for Simon Pike (Cheadle Hulme) and James Fryers (Jesmond Dene).  There were second places for Julia Johnson (Cross Flatts) and Emma Stead (Horton Park).  In terms of Parkrun milestones Edward Holley completed his 25th parkrun at Penistone.  Age graded runners of the week were Dawn Broom (89.27%), Julie Johnson (86.02%), Suzanne McGill (78.25%), Ian Neville (75.47%) and George Parr (75.29%).
