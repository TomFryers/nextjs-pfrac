summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results

Penistone junior Graihagh Turner represented South Yorkshire at the English Schools Cross Country Championships at Wollaton Park in Nottingham.  Graihagh’s eighth place in the junior girls race was enough to earn her selection for the England team which will complete in a home countries competition later this year.

Steve Sanders competed in the Sea to Sky race in Christchurch, New Zealand.  He finished in 18th place in a time of 1-35-30.

Dave Napier competed in the Colwyn Bay Metric Marathon, finishing in a time of 2-04-54 which gave him 48th place.

Closer to home a few Penistone runners made the short trip to Wakefield to compete in the Wakefield 10k.  First back for the club was Michael Walsh in 44-44.  Others competing were Michael Nicholson (46-43), Peter Beever (49-43) and John Spencer (1-20-27).

Dawn Broom took nearly 10 minutes off her own club over55 lady 20 mile record at the Knighton 20. The race consisted of 3 undulating loops through Staffordshire and Shropshire country lanes.  Her new record now stands at 2-40-54.
