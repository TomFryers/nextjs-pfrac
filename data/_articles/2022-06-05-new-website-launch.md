Today we have launched the new club website.  Completely rebuilt from scratch by club members Chris Hodgson and Paul Fryers, and restructured with the aim of making it more intuitive and helpful for club members and others. As well as the content about races, competitions, etc, it now includes a Google calendar with all the club races and club championship races, which anyone can link in to their own calendar or Outlook.  Please let us know what you think - it's a first launch and we expect there to be suggestions of how we can improve it!  The images come from various sources, but a lot of them, and particularly the good ones, are from Steve Frith!
