summary: Round-up of Penistone runners' results
---
Graihagh Turner, who competes for Penistone on the fells and Rotherham on the road and cross country, was crowned Yorkshire U15 girls cross country champion at the weekend.  In a tight finish Graihagh finished one second ahead of her nearest rival in 15-51.  The championships were held near Ripon, North Yorkshire.  Graihagh’s performance means she will be selected to compete for Yorkshire at the inter-county championships later this year. 

Fourteen Penistone runners took part in the multi stage Round Sheffield Run which is 20km in distance and covers trails and parkland around Sheffield.  There are eleven timed sections which gives the race a unique format consisting of eleven mini races in one.  First back for Penistone was Gareth Irvine in a total time of 1-29-55 which gave him a position of 90th overall.  First lady back for Penistone was Bec Crossland in 1-39-13. 

Penistone runners were also in action on the fells.  Twelve took on the [Wormstones](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2023/wormstones) fell race which takes place in the Kinder Scout area of the Peak District.  Steve Sanders was first back in 42nd place in 45-32.  First lady back was Lesley Parker in 55-37.  Bernice Nixon claimed first place in the ladies over65 age category.  Four hardy runners took on the Lamb's Longer Leg fell race, near Hayfield.  Completing the 3.1 mile race, which has over a thousand feet of ascent, were Ray Brown, Barbara Haigh, Damian Kilpin and Sarah Williams.  Slightly further afield Steve Sanders completed the [Scout Scar](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/fell-league-2023/scout-scar) fell race which takes place in the Lake District, finishing 61st in 35-27.

In slightly warmer climes Nick Whittingham competed in the San Silverstre Competa race in Spain.  Nick finished in 31st place in a time of 56 minutes.

Saturday saw large fields of runners taking part in local [parkruns](https://results.pfrac.co.uk/parkrun-2024/2024-01-06) as new year’s resolutions kicked in.  Tom Fryers claimed first spot at the Penistone parkrun and Damian Kilpin was second at Dewsbury.
