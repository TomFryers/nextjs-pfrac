The route is 8 miles in length and takes in a combination of tracks, trails and roads.  The winner of the ladies race was Emily Cowper-Coles and the men’s winner was Barnsley Harrier Alan Ford.  Penistone men packed well to claim the men’s team prize.  The team was made up of George Parr (2nd), Tom Fryers (3rd) and James Fryers (4th).  A number of Penistone runners claimed age category wins.  Richard Docker was first in the men’s over60 category, Barbara Haigh claimed the lady’s over75 prize and Ray Brown won the men’s over80.
