Juniors can compete in the South Yorkshire Indoor and Outdoor track and field series, and other open events. For more details see the [Juniors](https://pfrac.chrishodgson.co.uk/about/juniors) page.

In 2017, for the first time for many years, the club joined the Northern Track &amp; Field league. Early fixtures in 2017 were poorly attended, but later that year and throughout 2018 and 2019 we fielded much stronger teams as more members discovered how much fun it could be! We finished 5th overall in division 4EC in 2017 and 2018, and 3rd in 2019. Links to the results for all previous fixtures are at the bottom of this page.

The 2020 season was abandoned without a shot being put in anger, due the the Covid-19 pandemic. The structure of the league was revised for 2021 and we finished 7th in the new East 2 Division, where we remain for 2022. The series consists of four meetings between May and August, the events are paid for by the club and are hence free for all members.

Everyone is welcome to join in and help the club &ndash; you don't need to be an expert in an event to get points, but you do need to be there. All members who are first claim Penistone for Track &amp; Field, are in the under 17 age category or above (school year 10 or above) and have paid their England Athletics registration fee are eligible.

Anyone interested in competing, or just wanting more information, should get in touch with [Paul Fryers](mailto:paul.fryers@gmail.com) or [Shaun Dimelow](mailto:shaundimelow@hotmail.com).

The club also really needs members to become qualified track and field officials. We are supposed to provide a number of qualified track and field officials, and have a number of people in the process of qualifying, but still need more. The club will pay for courses, so if you are interested please get in touch with [Paul Fryers](mailto:paul.fryers@gmail.com) or [Martyn Cartwright](mailto:martynandpauline@gmail.com).
