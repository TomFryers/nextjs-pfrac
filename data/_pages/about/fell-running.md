Off-road running is a big part of the club, with options on Tuesdays and Thursdays from the club and active informal groups on other days.  Many members compete in [fell races](https://www.fellrunner.org.uk/races) and members of the club organise several local fell and trail races:
- [Hartcliff Hill Race](https://pfrac.chrishodgson.co.uk/races/hartcliff-hill-race), [Oughtibridge Chase](https://www.oughtibridgegala.org/the-tom-holmes-gala-chase), [Oxspring Hunshelf Amble](https://pfrac.chrishodgson.co.uk/races/oxspring-hunshelf-amble), [Penistone Hill Race](https://pfrac.chrishodgson.co.uk/races/penistone-hill-race), [The Trunce](http://www.trunce.org/2022-race-dates/), [Thurlstone Chase](https://pfrac.chrishodgson.co.uk/races/thurlstone-chase)
- We enter fell relays, such as the [British Athletics Fell and Hill Relay Championships](https://www.fellrunner.org.uk/championships/british-championships#relay), the [Hodgson Brothers Mountain Relay](https://hbmr.org.uk/) and Regional and National road relays
- There is a Fell section to the [Club Championship](https://pfrac.chrishodgson.co.uk/competitions/club-championship), with local races selected each year across a range of distances
- We have a [Fell League](https://pfrac.chrishodgson.co.uk/competitions/fell-league) in which members accumulate points from all the fell races they compete in during the year, and prizes are awarded overall and in each age group.
