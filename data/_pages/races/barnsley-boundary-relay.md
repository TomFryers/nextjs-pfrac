The Barnsley Boundary Relay Race is a multi-terrain race following the boundary of Barnsley MBC, using the route of the [Barnsley Boundary Long Distance Path](http://www.ldwa.org.uk/ldp/members/show_path.php?path_name=Barnsley+Boundary+Walk). It is a race for teams of 10, each running legs on roads, tracks and footpaths of between 4 and 11Â½ miles: 72 miles in total.



It is organised by Penistone Footpath Runners in conjunction with [Barnsley Rockley Rotary Club](http://barnsleyrockleyrotary.org.uk/) and with the support of other local running clubs.



Entries are welcome from any running clubs, organisations or businesses.  Some legs require some navigation or previous knowledge - there are plenty of opportunities to be shown the way before the day.  It is an sociable event.



GPX files and maps are available for all 10 legs below. If you had previously downloaded files from here you are advised to replace them with the current ones: all 10 were checked on the ground in April 2021.



The race is run under a England Athletics licence and minimum ages apply based on the distance of each leg: the minimum age for legs 1, 5, 8 and 10 is 16 and for all other legs is 17.

### The route



The first leg starts at 8am. The second leg starts when the first runner reaches the end of leg 1. All leg 2 runners set off together, and so on through the race. Times for each leg are aggregated at the end of the race and the fastest teams in each category (Men, M40+, M50+, M60+, Ladies, L40+ and Mixed) announced at the prize ceremony, which is held in the evening after the race.



Ordnance survey map, aerial photography and GPX files for the whole route are available [here](http://www.gps-routes.co.uk/routes/home.nsf/RoutesLinksWalks/barnsley-boundary-walk-walking-route#). Note that the race route does not always follow the same route as marked on the Ordnance Survey maps or the Walking Guides.



The links below give maps and GPX files for each leg. The GPX files can be downloaded and imported into GPS software, or uploaded to a phone or watch.
