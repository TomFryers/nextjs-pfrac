The Amble's Revenge is a trail race based on the former Hunshelf Amble. Whereas the former race started and finished in Green Moor, taking in Oxspring en route, the 7½ mile, undulating, mainly off-road race now starts and finishes in Oxspring, passing through Green Moor.  It takes place around Christmas or New Year.

Between 2014 and 2019 the "Oxspring Hunshelf Amble" was run in the early Summer, following a similar route but run the opposite way round to the Revenge.

The race has chip timing, and there is a gift for all entrants.

#### Entry

Online entry will be available nearer the event.

Pre-entry fees: £12 for EA registered runners and £14 for non-EA registered.  Entries on the day if the race limit of 350 is not reached for an additional £2.

#### Registration
