The Oxspring Hunshelf Amble is a multi-terrain race based on the former Hunshelf Amble. Whereas the former race started and finished in Green Moor, taking in Oxspring en route, the 7½ mile, undulating, mainly off-road race now starts and finishes in Oxspring, passing through Green Moor.

The Amble's Revenge, run around New Year, is approximately the same route in reverse, with a small diversion to avoid the stepping stones crossing of the Don, making it 8.1 miles in total.

The race has chip timing, and there is a gift for all entrants.
