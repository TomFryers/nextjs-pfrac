The junior winter handicap league allows all juniors to compete regularly from September and December. The course used is a marshalled 1100m lap on pavements and public footpaths. Under 11s do a single lap, under 13s two laps, under 15s and under 17s three laps. Start times are determined by previous personal best (PB) times, with points for finishing position and PBs. Points are awarded over the series of races and all competitors receive an award at the club's annual presentation evening.
